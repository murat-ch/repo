When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
	- In case if I want to collaborate on a project with other people and/or I want to be able work on different workstations and have all files updated.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	- Because it's possible that changes in remote are not correspond to your job done, or you need to resolve conflicts with files. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one insead of another?

	- First of all fork feature exists only inside GitHub. And it acts like clone repository to you GitHub user account.
	- You clone project to your local machine and keep reference to repository you clone from as remote.
	- Branch is version of a project in your local repository.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	- Then you know how far you from now, and can predict conflicts
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	- For now I don't see what could be easier. You can't collaborate work on the same file. Possibly you can divide you work by files or modules of files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?	
	- To keep my changes separately from others and then merge manually.
